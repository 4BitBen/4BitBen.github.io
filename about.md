# About Me
My name is Ben, and I am currently a senior software engineer at Fluke Networks in Colorado. My passion is in 
distributed systems and automation, while being involved in the full life cycle of a product. Here are a few things 
that are important me:

## Learning
I am obsessed with learning. I enjoy [reading papers](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love), 
[blogs](http://www.bailis.org/blog/), and learning new tools and techniques that help make development easier.  As I 
learn, I try to apply what I learn. If possible, I enjoy sharing what I have learned, as well as learning from others. 

## Sandbox Environment
I enjoy using tools that give me some level of isolation - either machine isolation through [Vagrant](www.vagrantup.com) 
or process isolation through [Docker](www.docker.com). This makes it very easy to learn a tool or technique without 
affecting my day-to-day environment.

## Automation
Automating the provisioning of the machine or process through some combination of CM tools - scripts, 
[Puppet](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet), etc. - is extremely important. This allows me to easily switch learning 
contexts or even share what I am learning with someone else.

## Fail Fast
Errors are inevitable. I want to know as quickly as possible when that happens. It could be as easy as a compiler 
telling me that, unit tests that indicate a logic error through [example-based tests](http://junit.org/) or 
[property-based tests](https://github.com/pholser/junit-quickcheck), or [static analysis tools](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/)
that might show a concurrency error. All of these are ways to help me know when an error has occurred.

## Metrics
I enjoy understanding how my code works in the wild. By [instrumenting my code](https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics),
I am able to understand where it is taking its time - I find it best to instrument things I can't control - File I/O, 
calling a database, calling a service, etc. Using this information, I know where to focus my attention to optimize
rather than guess where to focus my attention and pre-optimize.

Most information here will be around my journey as I continue to learn and share.
