# About Me
I'm Ben and I work at Fluke Networks. I am obsessed with learning. I enjoy reading papers and learning new tools and techniques that help make development easier. I also enjoy understanding how my code works in the wild. 

Most information here will be around my journey as I continue to learn and share.
