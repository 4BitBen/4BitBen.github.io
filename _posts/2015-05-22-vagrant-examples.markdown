I have been using Vagrant for over a year now. I find it incredibly useful. I created some very simple examples to 
show the different aspects of Vagrant - networking, synced folders, provisioning, etc. I tried to bring it all together
with a github page for the repository. I hope people will see the use as they go through the examples.  Here is the
