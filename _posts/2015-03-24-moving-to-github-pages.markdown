I am moving to use Github Pages. I plan to write my ideas and what I have learned. I will also migrate my few posts from wordpress over here.

I hope others will find it useful. If not, it will at least allow me to get better and organizing my thoughts and being more articulate in presenting my ideas.

More to come...
