<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I wanted my first post to be like a typical "Hello World" program people do.  The point isn't to solve a problem but to learn about a given technology.  People have gotten more creative about the "Hello World" program - e.g. the <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TODO app for MV* frameworks</a>.</p>
<h1>Why Blog</h1>
<p>I am terrible at writing.  I did not like taking English writing courses growing up.  I enjoyed diagramming sentences more than writing sentences.  I am starting to blog because I am hoping that it will benefit me.  Kind of a selfish reason but oh well.  Nathan Marz had a good <a href="http://bit.ly/18niNrY">blog post</a> about blogging.  The reasons on his post are some of the reasons why I am starting to blog.  I do hope that at least one of my blog posts will benefit someone, but that is more of a secondary reason.</p>
<p>I've noticed over the past few months that as I read a topic, I get to a certain level of understanding.  If I talk with others and try to explain what I read to them, I am able to get to a deeper level of understanding because they might ask questions I hadn't thought of and I have to revisit the topic.  I have begun writing notes on Google Docs and feel that by writing down my thoughts on a given topic I am able to get to an even deeper level of understanding.  These three things - reading, discussing, and writing - all fit under one piece: learning the theoretical.  The other piece - which is just as important - is the doing: going through the tutorial of a given technology, try to solve a known (to you) problem with that technology, contributing back to that technology, etc.</p>
<p>My hope is to get better at both.  So, blogging is my venture into reading, discussing, and finally writing about what I learn.  I will try as much as possible to cite my references.  In some cases, it will be Wikipedia.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;">Filling the gaps</span></p>
<p>I find sometimes that as I learn something and implement what I have learned, there are times when I take a step back and realize I have some missing gaps in my knowledge.  Then, I will try to fill in those missing gaps.  My first set of blogs will be around some gaps that I have recently filled: data structures and algorithms.  I feel that these are the essential building blocks - i.e. tools - for any software engineer.  I want to have the most amount of tools for my craft, so I will be able to solve problems in the best possible manner given its inputs and outputs instead of having the mindset of having my hammer and everything looks like a nail to me.</p>
<h1>In conclusion...</h1>
<p>My wife is a teacher and she hates it when kids use 'In conclusion' to finish their writing, so this is for her :P.  I do hope that people will read this and get something out of it.  I know I will get something out of this by getting better at something I am not good at - writing - and being able to more clearly consolidate and explain my ideas.  If you have any feedback, please be constructive about it.  Thanks and enjoy!</p>
